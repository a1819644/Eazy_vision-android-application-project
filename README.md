# Welcome to the Eazy_vision-android-application-project wiki!

We have developed this application to move a step towards fair bill sharing among the tenants. This application allows users to create group, pay their bills, track their bills and finally create a transparency of their shares. 

I worked as a backend developer for this project, where I wrote the CRUD API's, database to handle the thousands of groups. I used Firebase as our hosting site. Readers may check my code here [Link](https://github.com/a1819644/Eazy_vision-android-application-project/blob/main/API.js)

# How it works
This application works together with Camera which communicates with the application in order to trace the tenant's presence in the house. Based on the stays, the bills are being shared.
